\title{The Artificial Data of Consisting of as Many as 31 Randomly Placed Gaussian Clusters}
\description{
This artificial data was generated to show the strength of SUPC.
Clustering \code{D31} dataset is difficult for the partition type of clustering algorithms that require an initial set.
However, SUP correctly identifies the 31 major clusters.
